Caveats:
1. 'Not Available' appears when the denominator population for a rate measure is not available.
2. Each birth record represents one liveborn infant.
3. Birth rates are calculated as the number of births divided by total population in the given year(s). When the numerator is
"sub-set by mother's race, mother's hispanicity, location, or year of birth, then the same sub-set for age, race, hispanicity,"
location and year applies to the denominator population.
4. Fertility rates are calculated as the number of births divided by the number of females age 15 - 44 years old in the given
"year(s). When the numerator is sub-set by mother's age, mother's race, mother's hispanicity, location, or year of birth, then"
"the same sub-set for age, race, hispanicity, location and year applies to the denominator population. However, if you sub-set"
"mother's age selecting some years not in the 15 - 44 range, those years of mother's age ouside this range will not be included"
"in the denominator population. If you sub-set mother's age selecting only years outside the 15 - 44 range, Not Available is"
reported for the denominator population. Single race categories are not available for births before year 2016. Bridged race
categories are not available for births after year 2019.
5. Caution should be used when interpreting the Average Age of Mother measure. All ages 12 years and less are coded to 12 years.
All ages 50 years and over are coded to 50 years. The number of counts in those two age goups are small and should not have a
great effect on the average age. Consider doing queries with and without these two age groups and compare the effect on Average
Age of Mother measure.
6. Please note that the Percent of Total presented here may not be consistent with percentages published by NCHS. NCHS excludes
"births categorized as Unknown, Not Stated, Not on Certificate, Excluded, and Not Reported from the"
denominator when calculating percentages.
7. Records where the Birth Weight is Unknown or Not Stated are not included in the calculation of the Average Birth
Weight measure.
8. Records where the gestation age is Unknown or Not Stated are not included in the calculation of the Average Gestational
Age measure.
9. Birth rates and fertility rates are calculated using the following populations: The populations for year 2023 are from the
"postcensal single race series of July 1st estimates of the resident population, released by Census Bureau on June 27, 2024. The"
"2023 population estimates are based on the Blended Base produced by the US Census Bureau in lieu of the April 1, 2020 decennial"
population count. Bridged race population figures are not available for year 2023. The populations for year 2022 are from the
"postcensal single race series of July 1st estimates of the resident population, released by Census Bureau on June 22, 2023. The"
"2022 population estimates are based on the Blended Base produced by the US Census Bureau in lieu of the April 1, 2020 decennial"
population count. Bridged race population figures are not available for year 2022. The populations for year 2021 are from the
"postcensal single race series of July 1st estimates of the resident population, released by Census Bureau on June 30, 2022. The"
"2021 population estimates are based on the Blended Base produced by the US Census Bureau in lieu of the April 1, 2020 decennial"
population count. Bridged race population figures are not available for year 2021. The populations for year 2020 are from the
"postcensal single-race series of July 1st estimates of the resident population, released by Census Bureau on July 27, 2021; and"
"the postcensal bridged-race series of July 1st estimates of the resident population, released by NCHS on September 22, 2021 (for"
fertility rate denominators by detailed age groups). The populations for year 2019 are from the postcensal single-race series of
"July 1st estimates of the resident population, released by Census Bureau on June 25, 2020; and the postcensal bridged-race"
"series of July 1st estimates of the resident population, released by NCHS on July 9, 2020. The populations for year 2018 are"

"series of July 1st estimates of the resident population, released by NCHS on June 13, 2013. The populations for year 2011 are"
"from the postcensal bridged-race series of July 1st estimates of the resident population, released by NCHS on July 18, 2012. The"
"populations for year 2010 are the bridged-race April 1, 2010 Census counts. The populations for years 2007-2009 are from the"
"revised intercensal bridged-race series of July 1st estimates of the resident population, released by NCHS on October 26, 2012."
